## Problem Statement 

Between 2018 and 2019, the organization experienced a significant drop in customer acquisition, with the average number of new customers per month declining by 46%â€”from 5.2 to 2.8. This downward trend raised concerns about a potential loss of market share and emerging risks to overall business growth.
